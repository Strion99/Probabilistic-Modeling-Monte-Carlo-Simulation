# Probabilistic-Modeling-Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Developed a statistical model using Bayesian Inference to calculate posterior probabilities and error rates (False/True Positives).  Executed Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 samples) to analyze probability densities and visualize Central Limit Theorem convergence.
